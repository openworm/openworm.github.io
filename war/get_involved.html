			    OpenWorm aims to build the first comprehensive computational model of the <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> (<em>C. elegans</em>), a microscopic roundworm.
			    With only a <strong>thousand cells</strong>, it solves basic problems such as feeding, mate-finding and predator avoidance.
			    Despite being extremely well studied in biology, this organism still eludes a deep, principled understanding of its biology.

			    We are using a <strong>bottom-up</strong> approach, aimed at observing the worm behaviour <strong>emerge</strong> from a simulation of data derived from scientific experiments carried out over the past decade.
			    To do so, we are incorporating the data available in the scientific community into software models.
			    We are engineering <strong>Geppetto</strong> and <strong>Sibernetic</strong>, open-source simulation platforms, 
			    to be able to run these different models in concert.
			    We are also forging new collaborations with universities and research institutes to collect data that fill in the gaps.

			    One thing we need more than anything is for people to know about us. Getting visibility for the project will help us attract attention, <strong>raise awareness</strong> and ultimately reach our <a href="./getting_started.html#goal">goal</a> faster.
			    <br/><br/>
			    We've assembled information about the project  to help you better understand the project and find places to help out.
			    <br/><br/>
			    If you would like to help us you can <strong>spread the word</strong> with your family and friends and explain to them how a biologically accurate simulation of a tiny worm could help a lot to accelerate the cure of diseases.
			    You can also tell your geek friends how it would be totally cool to have a virtual worm living inside your computer.
			    <br/><br/>
			    Also if there is anything you think you could help us with which doesn't fall in any of the above categories please  <a href="./contacts.html">contact us</a>, we would <strong>love</strong> to hear from you!
