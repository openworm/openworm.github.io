			A prerequisite for simulating the biophysics of complex biological tissues and whole organisms are

			computational descriptions of biological matter that are flexible and can interface with materials of

			different viscosities, such as liquid. The landscape of software that is easily available to do such work is

			limited and lacks essential features necessary for combining elastic matter with simulations of liquids.

			Here we present an open source software package called Sibernetic, designed for the physical simulation

			of biomechanical matter (membranes, elastic matter, contractile matter) and environments (liquids,

			solids and elastic matter with variable physical properties). At its core, Sibernetic is built as an extension

			to Predictive–Corrective Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (PCISPH). Sibernetic is built

			on top of OpenCL, making it possible to run simulations on CPUs or GPUs, and has 3D visualization

			support built on top of OpenGL. Several test examples of the software running and reproducing physical

			experiments, as well as performance benchmarks, are presented and future directions are discussed.

			OpenWorm is an international collaboration with the aim of understanding how the behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)
			emerges from its underlying physiological processes. The project has developed a modular simulation engine to create computational
			models of the worm. The modularity of the engine makes it possible to easily modify the model, incorporate new experimental data and
			test hypotheses. The modeling framework incorporates both biophysical neuronal simulations and a novel fluid-dynamics-based soft-tissue
			simulation for physical environment-body interactions. The project's open-science approach is aimed at overcoming the difficulties of
			integrative modeling within a traditional academic environment. In this article the rationale is presented for creating the OpenWorm
			collaboration, the tools and resources developed thus far are outlined and the unique challenges associated with the project are discussed.

			The C. elegans connectome (White et al., 1986) is currently the most detailed connectome data set at the neuronal circuit level that is publicly available. Represented as a network graph, it consists of edges that distinguish between gap junctions and chemical synapses, weighted by synapse count, with nodes that represent neurons whose identities are unambiguous and well known.
			We have found exploration of the C. elegans connectome using hive plots to lead to the discovery of interesting qualitative structure that was previously not obvious, enabling this structure to be further pursued quantitatively using complex network mathematics.

			OpenWorm is an international collaboration with the aim of producing an integrative computational model of Caenorhabditis elegans to further the understanding of how macroscopic behaviour of the organism emerges from aggregated biophysical processes. A core component of the project involves the integration of electrophysiological modelling and predictive-corrective incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PCISPH) to model how neuronal and muscle dynamics effect the nematode's behaviour.

			The nematode C. elegans is the only animal with a known neuronal wiring diagram, or "connectome". During the last three decades, extensive studies of the C. elegans have provided wide-ranging data about it, but few systematic ways of integrating these data into a dynamic model have been put forward. Here we present a detailed demonstration of a virtual C. elegans aimed at integrating these data in the form of a 3D dynamic model operating in a simulated physical environment. Our current demonstration includes a realistic flexible worm body model, muscular system and a partially implemented ventral neural cord. Our virtual C. elegans demonstrates successful forward and backward locomotion when sending sinusoidal patterns of neuronal activity to groups of motor neurons. To account for the relatively slow propagation velocity and the attenuation of neuronal signals, we introduced "pseudo neurons" into our model to simulate simplified neuronal dynamics. The pseudo neurons also provide a good way of visualizing the nervous system's structure and activity dynamics.

			Computational biology is asserting itself as an important approach to understanding complex biological systems.
			In order to be able to effectively manage the complexity that comes with integrating and maintaining coarse-grained architectures, tools, digital information artifacts and code-bases, it is important for computational biology to fully embrace software engineering methodologies and best practices and follow the lead of the simulation based research in the physical sciences.
			Taking cues from pioneering projects in computational neuroscience that are addressing this problem (MOOSE, http://j.mp/gSZZNF, Clones; http://j.mp/gzC5CP), we describe our approach to the integration of close-to-the-metal massively parallel simulations with high-level abstractions through the use of design patterns, including emerging paradigms for GPU-based parallel programming.
