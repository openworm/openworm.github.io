            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Background</h1>
            </div>

            <p class="lead">We know that there is a huge amount of research which happens which is
              relevant to the goals of the OpenWorm project, but is not in an immediately usable/compatible format.
              Many researchers/labs may wish to contribute to the project, but the day to day work of
              experiments/analysis/publishing take priority.</p>

            <p class="lead"><strong>OpenWorm Studentships</strong> are a new way to incentivize contribution
              to the project, offering small stipends and recognition to junior researchers who want to spend time bringing their research into the
              OpenWorm project and making it more accessible for the wider community.</p>

          </section>

          <section id="Who">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Who is this aimed at?</h1>
            </div>

            <p class="lead">Anyone involved in <i>C. elegans</i> research who has (or whose lab has) produced data,
              models or software, which has been publicly released and which would be useful for the OpenWorm project.</p>

            <p class="lead">While it's not absolutely necessary that the recipient was personally involved in generating the data, there should be
              some connection to those who produced the data, to ensure that any questions about the data and any clarifying queries are
              quickly answered during the period of the project. For this reason a PhD student/postdoc in the lab which published the data
              would be an ideal candidate for this project.</p>

          </section>

          <section id="What">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>What is required?</h1>
            </div>

            <p class="lead">The proposed work should focus on translating <b>existing research outputs</b> to open formats,
              and integrating them with OpenWorm’s resources/repositories/documentation. It is assumed that the model/application/dataset will already be published
              (even in preprint form), and the time will be spent in making this as accessible/reusable as possible.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Studentship recipient should outline their plans in the application (see below) and if selected, spend 2-3 months
              working to incorporate the resources into OpenWorm. They will be assigned a mentor from the project to help ensure the resources are
              well integrated with our existing online content.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">Examples of potential activities include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li class="lead">Converting datasets from original formats (Excel spreadsheets, MAT files) into more open, standardised forms (e.g. NWB), ideally with rich metadata embedded</li>
              <li class="lead">Creating Jupyter notebooks outlining how to explore/analyse data or models</li>
              <li class="lead">Adding models/simulation code to GitHub, adding installation/usage documentation, adding continuous integration/testing</li>
              <li class="lead">Converting models to standardised NeuroML format</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">While in exceptional cases an applicant could propose to use data that is not yet released, we fully acknowledge the importance of
              getting peer reviewed publications as part of a PhD/postdoc, and these activities should take priority when deciding how/when data
              should be released. Given the short timeline for the studentship projects, there is a need to avoid a situation where public release of data
              by a lab is held up due to publication delays. Therefore it is best if the data is already in the public domain at the time of application.</p>
