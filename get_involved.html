				Do you share our vision? Do you believe that to accelerate <strong>drug discovery</strong> we need better predictive models for biology? Are you an advocate of <strong>open science</strong>?
				<br/><br/>
				OpenWorm is not supported by traditional research grants.  Everything that was done so far happened thanks to the passion of our <a href="./people.html">volunteers</a>.
				Imagine how fast we could <strong>accelerate</strong> our development with <a href="./donate.html">your support</a>.

				One thing we need more than anything is for people to know about us. Getting visibility for the project will help us attract attention, <strong>raise awareness</strong> and ultimately reach our <a href="./getting_started.html#goal">goal</a> faster.
				<br/><br/>
				We've assembled information about the project <a href="https://docs.openworm.org/#navigating-openworm" target="_blank">in our documentation</a> to help you better understand the project and find places to help out.
				<br/><br/>
				If you would like to help us you can <strong>spread the word</strong> with your family and friends and explain to them how a biologically accurate simulation of a tiny worm could help a lot to accelerate the cure of diseases.
				You can also tell your geek friends how it would be totally cool to have a virtual worm living inside your computer.
				<br/><br/>
				Also if there is anything you think you could help us with which doesn't fall in any of the above categories please  <a href="./contacts.html">contact us</a>, we would <strong>love</strong> to hear from you!
